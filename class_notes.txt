# version control using PyCharm's GUI
# -----------------------------------

#  Enable git as your local version control system. In the PyCharm GUI go to VCS -> Enable Version Control Integration.
# Make sure that you select Git when asked which version control system to use.
# This is equivalent to typing git init in the Terminal.\

# If successful, you should now have a new Git Pane (bottomm left) where you can see the Git Console and Git Logs

# Add the Unversioned Files and Commit:
# 1) All the files in our project will turn red because they are not yet added to the staging area to be tracked by git.
# 2) Add and commit your files to version control using the Commit tool (The Commit tool window will become visible on
#    the left side after you've enabled version control. The files and folders (e.g., PyCharm's .idea folder) listed in
#    the .gitignore file will be excluded.
# 3) Add all the unversioned files, write your commit message and click "commit".
# 4) All the tracked files should now no longer be red.
# 5) If successful, you should now be able to see your first commit in the Git Log pane
